## Updates/Goals (10/19/20):

- Stick with a yearly resolution for now

- Should be able to pre-filter by ICD codes and ~aggregate upstream, so data volume shouldn't be an issue (*ALSO*, only need one year of data). The data table should still be relevant here.

- Correction on exposures: they are actually hierarchical (e.g. >21m/s is a subset of >12m/s). The consensus is that we should stick with just 21 m/s for the time being (to give a more intuitive, conservative, estimate). Longer-term, we should consider rerunning the underlying model to give discrete exposure intervals; also chance to address ages, other demographics.

- Biggest change: use the `tigris` pacakge to start plotting exposures, mortality, etc., spatially. 

## Visual Overview of process (1st draft)


![First pass on a visual overview](cira_conceptual_diagram_v1.png)


## Importing Data

> 1) For storm exposure data, using the `storm_winds` dataset from the `hurricaneexposuredata` package.

> 2) For an example of monthly mortality data, importing 2016-2018 FL and GA mortality figures from CDC Wonder (still working on API process; using a locally-saved copy for now).

```{r}
#still trying to work out API; in theory should be able to obtain XMLs using `view source`, but it points me to an ~access denied page.

#Can export query-specific URLs (e.g. https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D76/D93F306 for Louisiana data from 2018, all-causes, grouped by ICD chapter and subchapter), but so far can't figure out if I can use that to get XMLs

```
  
>> Locating the annual (2018) mortality figures on CDC has gone smoothly, and we have some latitude to add more detail if desired. As far as I could tell there werent any additional major ~subchapter changes between ICD9 and ICD10 for `External` and `Respiratory` deaths, but I'm not yet positive (could have overlooked the relevant information).

>> As we discussed, I'm sticking with a 21m/s exposue for now to give more ~conservative estimates.

# 1) using `storm_winds` dataset:

# 2) Now using annual-resolution 2018 data; restricted Circulatory deaths, but otherwise unchanged.

  # ~philosophically, this includes categories like homicide, suicide, police/military-linked deaths, medical complications, etc., in addition to accidents strictly speaking. 

#example:

mortality_cardio %>% head()


# Manually pulling in RRs from NEJM paper:
  # order is 12, 15, 18, 21 m/s; using last for now:

# Merging all types (seeing if this makes for less redundancy downstream)
  # can take advantage of only using 21 m/s for now, but need to think about how best to accomodate multiple RRS--maybe include the entire vector and call e.g. .$rr[4] when needed?
    # Worst case could use a `case_when` block; a bit awkward but definitely workable
