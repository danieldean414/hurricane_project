## Updates/Goals (10/19/20):

- Stick with a yearly resolution for now

- Should be able to pre-filter by ICD codes and ~aggregate upstream, so data volume shouldn't be an issue (*ALSO*, only need one year of data). The data table should still be relevant here.

- Correction on exposures: they are actually hierarchical (e.g. >21m/s is a subset of >12m/s). The consensus is that we should stick with just 21 m/s for the time being (to give a more intuitive, conservative, estimate). Longer-term, we should consider rerunning the underlying model to give discrete exposure intervals; also chance to address ages, other demographics.

- Biggest change: use the `tigris` pacakge to start plotting exposures, mortality, etc., spatially.

## Importing Data

> 1) For storm exposure data, using the `storm_winds` dataset from the `hurricaneexposuredata` package.

> 2) We obtained 2018 county-level mortality and population figures from CDC Wonder, aggregating across ICD chapters for the year. 

>> 2a) Locating the annual (2018) mortality figures on CDC has gone smoothly, and we have some latitude to add more detail if desired. As far as I could tell there weren't any additional major ~subchapter changes between ICD9 and ICD10 for `External` and `Respiratory` deaths, but I'm not yet positive (could have overlooked the relevant information). However, ICD10 subchapters i180-190 were removed to match the ICD9 analog. 

>> 2b) As we discussed, I'm sticking with a 21m/s exposue for now to give more ~conservative estimates. 

> 3) The `storm_winds` dataset from the `hurricane_exposure` package was used to provide details on TC exposures based on population-weighted county centers. Events per year were categorized based on maximum sustained wind speeds. Wind exposure levels from the NEJM paper (>12, >15, >18, >21, m/s) were used to categorize event counts per year.

>> 3a) For future development, it may be interesting to extrapolate a relationship between risk ratios and wind speed as a continuous variable, rather than 4 parallel models. 

> 4) The datasets were merged using county FIPS codes (*Important assumption: so far I'm using only single-year 2018 CDC data for mortality rates, but the full ~30-yr dataset for storm events*).

> 5) Exposure levels from the NEJM paper were matched to the merged data based on combinations of mortality type and wind exposure; some rearrangement was needed to accomodate the nested nature of the exposures.

# OK, seems to have worked; notes on using:
  # ALWAYS pre-filter only for exposure of interest AND `TRUE`
    # i.e. only filtering for 15m/s would include T and F results
      # ~Counterpoint: At this stage, I don't think `FALSE` rows include any useful information--pretty sure I could just remove all of them

  #went ahead and did that....
  # So just filter to type/exposure of interest
  # !! In addition, note that all-cause isn't ~compatible w/ other causes


## Two counties (48261, 48311) are apparently present in the storm data, but missing from CDC data--no deaths of any kind? <-- Both are very small counties is TX, so plausible; also would fall well blow the 400k threshold in any case
    # 48311 = McMullen, TX (2010 census pop = 707)
    # 48261 = Kennedy county, TX; population was 416 in 2010 census

#  Elevated deaths seem plausible...
